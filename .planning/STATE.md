# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-03)

**Core value:** Sellers walk into every meeting prepared and walk out of every meeting with a polished, brand-compliant proposal deck in under 2 hours — not 24 to 120 hours.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Monorepo Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 10 (Monorepo Foundation)
Plan: 1 of 3 in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-03-03 — Plan 01-01 complete (monorepo scaffold, apps/web, apps/agent)

Progress: [█░░░░░░░░░] 3%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 6 min
- Total execution time: 0.1 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| Phase 01-monorepo-foundation P01 | 6 min | 2 tasks | 20 files |

**Recent Trend:**

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: AtlusAI content ingestion is Phase 2 (critical path blocker — all RAG-dependent tests blocked until complete)
- [Roadmap]: Zod schema validation against live Gemini API is Phase 3 (isolated before any agent logic is built on top)
- [Roadmap]: HITL Checkpoint 1 (Phase 5) must be complete before Google Slides generation (Phase 7) can be tested end-to-end
- [Roadmap]: Pre-call briefing flow (Phase 9) is independent of post-call and can proceed in parallel with Phases 4-8 after Phase 3 is complete
- [Roadmap]: Phases 2 and 3 have no interdependency and can run in parallel after Phase 1
- [Phase 01-monorepo-foundation]: zod 4.x used across all packages; @mastra/core 1.8.0 accepts ^3.25.0 || ^4.0.0
- [Phase 01-monorepo-foundation]: @mastra/libsql corrected to 1.6.2 (plan specified 0.2.0 which never existed on npm)
- [Phase 01-monorepo-foundation]: @typescript-eslint updated to 8.x for eslint 9 compatibility
- [Phase 01-monorepo-foundation]: Tailwind v3.4 confirmed (not v4); Next.js pinned to 15.x range as specified

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 3] Mastra suspend/resume API and storage adapter configuration must be verified against current Mastra docs (post-August 2025) — highest-uncertainty surface in the stack
- [Phase 2] AtlusAI MCP ingestion endpoint, supported metadata fields, and semantic search filter syntax must be verified against live AtlusAI documentation before designing the ingestion script
- [Phase 3] Gemini model ID string and Mastra Gemini provider package name (`@mastra/google` or equivalent) must be verified on npmjs.com before any LLM call configuration
- [Phase 1] Tailwind v4 confirmed stable as of March 2026 but v3.4 used per plan spec (shadcn/ui compatibility)
